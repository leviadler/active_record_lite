ActiveRecordLite
================

ActiceRecordLite is a lite (duh!) version of Rail's ActiveRecord. Not nearly as robust as the real thing, but still pretty cool. This version employs Ruby's powerful Meta-programming potention to create many of ActiveRecords methods, including:

* ::all
* ::attr_accessor
* belongs_to
* ::find
* has_many
* has_many_through
* #insert
* #save
* #update
* ::where


This fun metaprogramming experience also contains RSpect tests.
